Tastir is my dream entrepreneurial project. 

This is only the landing page of Tastir. I unfortunately do not have time to commit to the project right now, so it is only a landing page for now. 

Tasir is an app that aims to improve your dining experience. Think about it; who doesn't love tapas? Buffets? Tasting menus? Poopoo platters? While they're different cuisines and different names, they all share something: variety. 

You get so much flavor without being limited to a single entree. This is my favorite way to eat. 

Many restaurants, however, don't have options for this type of dining. That's where Tastir comes in. Tastir is a Groupon for tasting menus. That is, restaurants post "special" menus where you can sample lots of different dishes. 

Diners can purchase these menus on the site, and obtain a coupon for the tasting menus. Unlike Groupon, the goal isn't to reduce price, but rather to provide a better dining experience. The hope is that this will encourage diners to return to the restaurants, since they'll get a broader taste of it's dishes. This way, it'll be a profitable advertising model for restaurants, and an exciting, innovative way to dine for everyone else.
